**PetWell** is a full-stack Django e-commerce platform promoting holistic pet wellness and mindful living.  
Developed as **Portfolio Project 5** for the *Code Institute Full Stack Software Development Diploma*, it demonstrates advanced Django e-commerce architecture, Stripe integration, newsletter automation, Agile methodology, and deployment to Heroku.  
The goal is to create a trusted digital sanctuary where users can shop, learn, and connect through compassion and responsible pet care.

## 🌟 Overview
PetWell integrates five Django apps — **Shop**, **Cart**, **Checkout**, **Blog**, and **Newsletter** — forming a cohesive and responsive platform.  
The site combines functionality with emotional design, merging commerce with community storytelling.  
Built with the **MTV architecture**, it ensures modular development, maintainability, and data integrity.  
All media files are managed through **Cloudinary**, and the live app is powered by **Heroku PostgreSQL**.  
The entire structure was designed to achieve a seamless user journey, from discovery to purchase and engagement beyond the transaction.

## 💡 User Experience (UX)
PetWell provides intuitive navigation through the navbar linking Home, Shop, Blog, Cart, and Checkout.  
UX testing focused on clarity, emotional appeal, and consistency across devices.  
The interface maintains balance between functionality and empathy, emphasizing **trust, wellness, and warmth**.  
Responsive design ensures smooth operation on mobile, tablet, and desktop.  
Accessibility testing confirmed compliance with **WCAG 2.1** standards.  
Soft colors (#EAF3FF), white space, and rounded shapes evoke calmness and compassion.  
Every element serves both purpose and feeling — embodying mindful design.  

---

## 🎨 Design
PetWell’s interface harmonizes beauty and usability.  
Typography: **Open Sans** and **Poppins** for clarity and warmth.  
Icons: Bootstrap Icons for consistent branding.  
Cloudinary optimizes images dynamically.  
All forms and buttons use high-contrast and accessible focus states.  
Error pages like `404.html` are gentle and friendly, maintaining tone even during user mistakes.  
The visual system builds emotional safety — turning digital interaction into a caring experience.

---

## 🛍️ Shop
The **Shop app** displays curated products from the PostgreSQL database with CRUD control for admins.  
Each product includes Cloudinary image, description, price, and category.  
Dynamic filtering allows users to browse by wellness category or cost.  
Admin users can add or edit products through Django Admin or a custom interface.  
ORM queries ensure fast and scalable performance.  
The system was tested for form validation, ensuring data accuracy and proper feedback messages.

## 🧺 Cart
The **Cart app** uses Django’s session framework to store temporary cart data.  
When a user adds a product, the cart updates dynamically with item count and total cost.  
The design encourages a sense of control — users can modify quantities, remove items, or clear the cart entirely.  
Validation prevents invalid entries and negative quantities.  
All operations are handled server-side for security and consistency.

## 💳 Checkout
The **Checkout app** integrates **Stripe** for secure payments.  
Each transaction generates an Order record stored in PostgreSQL, linked with user and payment metadata.  
Stripe Webhooks validate payments to prevent fraud.  
After success, users receive a confirmation email via SendGrid and are redirected to an order summary.  
Admins can view orders via Django Admin.  
Testing confirmed payment accuracy, CSRF protection, and email delivery.

## 🧠 Blog
The **Blog app** supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for articles.  
Admins can create educational or healing content promoting compassion, awareness, and trust.  
Each article includes author, title, body, and optional image.  
Posts are ordered by creation date and displayed on a responsive grid layout.  
Form validation ensures quality and consistency of content.

## 💌 Newsletter & Email System
The **Newsletter** system connects directly to the user experience through the footer form.  
Each submission validates unique emails and stores them in a `Subscriber` model.  
Successful signups trigger automatic **welcome emails** via **SendGrid**.  
This fulfills the *Digital Marketing* requirement of the Code Institute project.  
It demonstrates end-to-end integration: form validation, database logic, and live email communication.  

---

## 💼 E-commerce Business Model & Marketing Strategy
PetWell operates under a **B2C (Business to Consumer)** model, offering physical and digital wellness products for pets.  
The marketing approach combines **content marketing (Blog)**, **email marketing (Newsletter)**, and **social media presence (Facebook/Instagram)**.  
The blog enhances SEO ranking and authority, newsletters improve retention, and social channels attract new customers through emotional engagement.  
Trust, compassion, and education form the core of PetWell’s strategy — creating a meaningful, ethical, and lasting customer relationship.
