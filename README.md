## üåü Overview

The **PetWell platform** was created to provide a smooth and enjoyable online shopping experience while promoting a deeper understanding of pet wellness. It combines e-commerce features such as browsing, product management, and secure checkout with educational content presented in a friendly, approachable tone. The project aims to showcase Django‚Äôs scalability and modular structure through multiple apps ‚Äî including products, checkout, cart, and blog ‚Äî all integrated into a cohesive system. The front-end was designed with Bootstrap 5 to ensure seamless responsiveness across devices and maintain a clean, modern look. The application emphasizes accessibility, performance, and a compassionate tone throughout the interface. Beyond technical delivery, PetWell also strives to embody emotional resonance by connecting users with meaningful stories about pets and their well-being.

## üí° User Experience (UX)

The UX design process focused on creating a calm, trustworthy atmosphere while maintaining professional usability standards. Every page was designed to provide clarity, purpose, and warmth ‚Äî ensuring that users felt welcome from the first visit. Navigation follows a minimalistic approach, with intuitive labeling and an easily accessible cart visible on all pages. Key UX goals included reducing cognitive load, ensuring users could complete purchases in minimal clicks, and maintaining visual consistency. The design approach was informed by user empathy ‚Äî understanding that pet owners often seek emotional reassurance alongside practical information. Clear feedback mechanisms (such as success messages, toasts, and alerts) were implemented to enhance interactivity and satisfaction. The checkout flow was refined to minimize friction and provide clear validation messages. Testing focused heavily on accessibility, ensuring color contrast and font readability met WCAG guidelines. Overall, the UX represents a balance of functional e-commerce efficiency and emotional comfort, mirroring the project‚Äôs ethos of care and connection.

## üé® Design

The **visual design** of PetWell is guided by simplicity, trust, and harmony. A clean white and blue color palette was chosen to evoke calmness and reliability while keeping the interface visually light. Typography uses the Bootstrap default sans-serif stack to ensure clarity and cross-device consistency. Icons from the Bootstrap Icons library complement the interface with intuitive visual cues that support usability without cluttering the layout. Layout spacing follows a modular 8px grid system, giving the site a structured yet breathable appearance. Images are hosted on **Cloudinary**, ensuring optimized loading speeds and automatic compression for enhanced performance. The design philosophy emphasizes the emotional tone of wellness ‚Äî using softness and balance in visuals to reflect empathy. Hover effects and transitions were added to provide subtle interactivity and a sense of liveliness. Special care was given to mobile-first design principles to ensure usability on iPhones, tablets, and smaller screens. Alt text was added to all key images, ensuring accessibility for assistive technologies. The design as a whole communicates professionalism with warmth ‚Äî a digital reflection of the love people share with their pets.

## üß≠ Agile Methodology

The entire project was built using **Agile methodology**, ensuring continuous progress tracking, adaptability, and reflection throughout development. The process was organized into **Epics** and **User Stories**, each corresponding to a major feature group or system module. A **GitHub Projects Kanban board** served as the backbone of workflow management, with issues categorized as ‚ÄúTo Do,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn Progress,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDone.‚Äù This allowed for daily visual tracking of tasks and sprint progress. Each user story included acceptance criteria, linked commits, and labels for priority (High / Medium / Low). Weekly mini-sprints concluded with reflections, focusing on what was achieved, what could improve, and how time was spent.  

### üîπ Agile Implementation Details
Epics were divided as follows:
- **EPIC 1:** Shop and product management (core e-commerce functionality)
- **EPIC 2:** Blog system (educational storytelling and engagement)
- **EPIC 3:** Checkout flow and Stripe readiness (security, transactions, UX)
- **EPIC 4:** UX, SEO, and deployment refinements (meta data, 404, responsiveness)

### üìã Example User Stories

| ID | User Story | Epic | Status |
|----|-------------|------|--------|
| 1 | As a user, I want to browse pet wellness products so that I can find items for my dog | Shop | ‚úÖ Done |
| 2 | As an admin, I want to create and manage blog posts so that I can share advice | Blog | ‚úÖ Done |
| 3 | As a user, I want to see my cart updates dynamically so that I know my total cost | Shop | ‚úÖ Done |
| 4 | As a user, I want to checkout securely so that my payment is safe | Checkout | ‚úÖ Done |
| 5 | As a visitor, I want to read about animal wellness so that I can learn compassion | Blog | ‚úÖ Done |
